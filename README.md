# Harness Skills

Claude Code skills for the [Harness.io](https://harness.io) CI/CD platform. Generate pipeline YAML, manage resources, debug failures, analyze costs, and more -- all from natural language.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- [Harness MCP v2 Server](https://github.com/thisrohangupta/harness-mcp-v2) -- required for MCP-powered skills. Most skills in this repo depend on this server for Harness API access.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
cd harness-skills
```

Skills are automatically available when Claude Code runs in this directory.

## Skill Anatomy

Each skill is a directory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: >-
  What the skill does, when to use it, and trigger phrases.
metadata:
  author: Harness
  version: 1.0.0
  mcp-server: harness-mcp-v2
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires Harness MCP v2 server (harness-mcp-v2)
---

# My Skill

Instructions for Claude to follow when this skill is invoked.
```

Skills can include a `references/` directory for supplementary material (report templates, role tables, extended examples) that Claude loads on demand.

## MCP Tools

MCP-powered skills use the [Harness MCP v2 server](https://github.com/thisrohangupta/harness-mcp-v2), which provides 10 generic tools dispatched by `resource_type`:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `harness_list` | List resources |
| `harness_get` | Get resource details |
| `harness_create` | Create a resource |
| `harness_update` | Update a resource |
| `harness_delete` | Delete a resource |
| `harness_execute` | Execute an action |
| `harness_search` | Search across resources |
| `harness_describe` | Get resource schema |
| `harness_diagnose` | Diagnose issues |
| `harness_status` | Check system status |
