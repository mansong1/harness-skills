# Webhook Manager

Manage Harness GitX Webhooks via MCP for Git repository sync.

## Webhook Structure

```yaml
webhook:
  identifier: main_repo_webhook
  name: Main Repository Webhook
  connectorRef: github_connector
  repo: my-org/my-repo
  folderPaths:
    - .harness/
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Requirements

- What repository needs sync?
- Which folders contain Harness configs?
- What scope? (Account, Org, Project)
- Which Git connector to use?

### Step 2: Create Webhook via MCP

```
Call MCP tool: harness_create
Parameters:
  resource_type: "gitx_webhook"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
  body:
    identifier: "project_webhook"
    name: "Project Config Webhook"
    connector_ref: "github_connector"
    repo: "my-org/my-service"
    folder_paths: [".harness/"]
```

### Step 3: Configure Git Provider

After creating the webhook in Harness, the user must add the returned webhook URL to their Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) under repository webhook settings.

### Step 4: List Webhooks

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "gitx_webhook"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
```

### Step 5: Update or Delete

```
Call MCP tool: harness_update
Parameters:
  resource_type: "gitx_webhook"
  resource_id: "<webhook_identifier>"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
  body: <updated webhook config>
```

```
Call MCP tool: harness_delete
Parameters:
  resource_type: "gitx_webhook"
  resource_id: "<webhook_identifier>"
```

## Webhook Scopes

| Scope | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| Account | Shared templates, account-level configs |
| Organization | Cross-project resources, org templates |
| Project | Project-specific pipelines, services |

## Recommended Folder Structure

```
.harness/
├── pipelines/
├── templates/
├── services/
├── environments/
└── infrastructures/
```

## Examples

- "Set up Git sync for my service repo" - Create project-level webhook with `.harness/` folder
- "Sync shared templates from a central repo" - Create org-level webhook for templates folder
- "List all GitX webhooks" - List webhooks at the appropriate scope
- "Update webhook to sync more folders" - Update with additional folder paths

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Received
- Verify webhook URL is configured in the Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
- Check content type is `application/json` in Git provider settings
- Ensure push and PR events are selected

### Entities Not Syncing
- Folder paths must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Files must be valid Harness YAML
- Connector must have read access to the repository

### Common Errors
- `CONNECTOR_NOT_FOUND` - Verify the Git connector exists and is accessible
- `REPOSITORY_NOT_FOUND` - Check repo name and connector permissions
- `DUPLICATE_IDENTIFIER` - Webhook with same identifier already exists
